Code for paper "Evidential time-to-event prediction with calibrated uncertainty quantification"
The Python code implements an evidential regression model specically designed for time-to-event prediction. The model computes a degree of belief for the event time occurring within a time interval, without any strict distribution assumption. Meanwhile, the proposed model quanti es both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties using Gaussian Random Fuzzy Numbers and belief functions, providing clinicians with uncertainty-aware survival time predictions.
